Testing out GitHub

Testing out the branching mechanic for git. This is useful if ever one makes a mistake and wants to roll back to the "master" branch version.
Note: ONLY PUSH TO THE MASTER BRANCH IF YOU ARE EXTREMELY SURE THAT THERE ARE NO MISTAKES IN THE CODE, OR AT LEAST THE CODE IS WORKING AS INTENDED.
